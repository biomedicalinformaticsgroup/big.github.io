Our main research goal is to develop and implement Informatics methods that enable analysis of biological data sets from a wide range of experimental application areas. We're especially interested in approaches that maximise the ability to harness information from multiple sources of data by developing new algorithms and software that implicitly analyse data jointly to provide novel biological insight. In order to achieve this our research interests span many areas of Informatics including:

- database systems
- algorithms
- high-performance computation
- software engineering
- agent-based modelling
- computational statistics
- applied machine learning
- natural language processing
- knowledge representation
