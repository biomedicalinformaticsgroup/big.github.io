<p>The paper contains a lot of detail about the pitfalls to avoid and important considerations to address related to bias, confounding variables, and other sources of technical error that have a large impact on how gene expression data should be analysed and interpretted. These are very often not considered in published studies so we believe that this makes the paper an even more interesting contribution to the field; even beyond ASD research.</p>

<p>Whilst these observations were replicated in 3 independent data sets, what was also clear is that, as you might expect, data is all. The heterogeneity of samples in terms of quality, brain region, age, and likely most importantly ASD severity are critical. Due to the nature of the data available we didn’t have the statistical power to separate out information by brain region and crucial patitent meta-data was absent preventing us from looking at the impact of ASD severity in these relationships.</p>
