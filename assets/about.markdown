We are the Biomedical Informatics group and are part of the institute for [Adaptive and Neural Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/anc) in the [School of Informatics](http://inf.ed.ac.uk), [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk).

We want to develop novel statistical and machine learning approaches that help us better understand human disease.


### Overview
Our work ranges from more traditional analysis of high-throughput molecular data such as that assessing gene expression and genetic variation information using sequencing technologies, to highly complex multi-modal integation strategies.

Most of our ongoing work focusses on this latter approach. Over the last 5-10 years it has become increasingly common for data derived from biological samples to be comprised of several different data types. In many cases formally integrated these "multi-modal" sets allows us to learn across the data typically increasing signal, minisiming noise and allowing us to access more of the information space.

Our focus has moved increasingly into the clinical/biomedical domain and most of our current research work uses data derived from large groups of patients. These data can arise from large international disease baed initiative such as:

- [The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative](https://www.ppmi-info.org)
- [The Simons Foundation for Autistm Resach Initiative (SFARI)](https://www.sfari.org)
- [The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga)

or biobank type initiatives that comprise a plethora of information about large cohorts of people extending into the thousands or 100s of thousands:

- [Generation Scotland](https://www.ed.ac.uk/generation-scotland)
- [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk)
- [Genomics England](https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk)
